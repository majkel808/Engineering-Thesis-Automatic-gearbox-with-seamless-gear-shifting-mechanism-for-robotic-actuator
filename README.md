# Engineering Thesis: Automatic gearbox with seamless gear shifting mechanism for robotic actuator

An actuator for a robot arm was designed, based on a variable transmission gearbox utilizing a cycloidal drive. The diploma thesis included a review of existing solutions, calculations related to the design of the cycloidal gearbox, and the development of 3D model of the divice.

## Detailed description
The aim of this thesis is to design a mechatronic system tasked with driving a robotic arm, whose work cycle will consist of frequent changes of the required torque. The gearbox being designed will allow for achieving two distinct, independent operating modes, which provide an ability to quickly switch between themselves without stopping the device. This will, in turn, allow the robot to choose the optimal operating mode, enabling either a higher load-bearing capacity or a higher angular velocity of the robotic arm. The project in question has been specifically designed for use in affordable automation and in education.
The design of the robotic arm allows it to achieve high angular velocity, while also being highly precise due to minimal play. To provide such functionality, two cus-tom cycloidal drives have been designed, one of which is used as a differential. Such a mechanism can rapidly and automatically alter the gear ratio of the gearbox.
